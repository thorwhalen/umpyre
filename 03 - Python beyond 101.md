Have a 10mn glance at what the definitiion of iterators and generators are. 
For example (but find better):
https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/generator
https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators

## Itertools:
Have a look at https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html

Read and understand a few of the "roughly equivalent" python code snippets that show you a simply python implementation 
of some of these functions. Try to get to the point that you'd be able to reproduce these from scratch:
- [repeat](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.repeat)
- [accumulate](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.accumulate)
- [chain](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.chain)
- [chain.from_iterable](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.chain.from_iterable)
- [islice](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.islice)


# sklearn

Browse around [https://scikit-learn.org/stable/]

Use the following lie as a map: [https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html]

(Remember, _art is a lie that reveals the truth_ (Picasso).)
