# Introduction to `partial(partial, partial)`

The `partial` function from Python's `functools` library is a transformative tool for rethinking code design. For those familiar with the concept of "currying" in functional programming, `partial` might feel somewhat familiar, though it's distinct. While currying involves creating functions with partially applied arguments, `partial` goes beyond that by letting you configure functions with fixed arguments, enhancing flexibility without changing function signatures.

Currying is a concept often hailed as an answer to the pitfalls of rigid object-oriented design, inviting programmers into a more functional approach to code structure. But even if currying isn't quite your thing, `partial` deserves exploration for how it can improve daily coding workflows. For developers comfortable with it, `partial` opens new ways to approach problems, promoting a style that's both concise and modular.

In this article, we'll explore an especially intriguing application of `partial` – a twist known as `partial(partial, partial)`.

## Building Up to `partial(partial, partial)`

We'll start with a simple example to see how this pattern emerges.

First, import the necessary modules:

```python
import os
from functools import partial
```

Let's say you need to work with file paths and want a way to make absolute paths from relative ones:

```python
>>> os.path.join('/my/root', 'a', 'b')
'/my/root/a/b'
```

### Fixing the Root Path

Often, the root path is fixed within a given context, but you might want a way to generate an "absolute path" function for each context. Here’s how you could use `partial` to create such a function:

```python
>>> abs_path = partial(os.path.join, '/my/root')
>>> abs_path('a', 'b')
'/my/root/a/b'
```

Now `abs_path` behaves like `os.path.join` but with the root path `/my/root` fixed.

### A Function That Makes Path-Making Functions

If you need this functionality often, you could create a function to generate these "absolute path makers":

```python
>>> mk_abs_path_maker = partial(partial, os.path.join)
>>> abs_path = mk_abs_path_maker('/my/root')
>>> abs_path('a', 'b')
'/my/root/a/b'
```

### Introducing `mk_factory`

We've set up a function that can take any function and fix its first argument. This leads us to `partial(partial, partial)`, which we'll call `mk_factory`. With `mk_factory`, you can create new functions by fixing the first argument of any existing function. Here's what it looks like:

```python
>>> mk_factory = partial(partial, partial)
```

### Example with `os.path.join`

```python
>>> mk_abs_path_maker = mk_factory(os.path.join)
>>> abs_path = mk_abs_path_maker('/my/root')
>>> abs_path('a', 'b')
'/my/root/a/b'
```

## Functional Bindings without Classes

One advantage of object-oriented programming is the ability to bind arguments to methods within a specific context. When methods are bound to a class instance, they gain access to the instance's data through `self`, essentially fixing the first argument. `mk_factory` provides a similar functionality by letting you "bind" arguments to a function without creating a class, allowing for lightweight, reusable functions across a codebase.

### A Lambda Alternative (With Drawbacks)

The same effect can be achieved with nested lambdas, though it’s less elegant and has limitations:

```python
first_arg_fixer_lambda = lambda func: lambda first_arg: lambda *args, **kwargs: func(first_arg, *args, **kwargs)

# Test
mk_abs_path_maker_lambda = first_arg_fixer_lambda(os.path.join)
abs_path = mk_abs_path_maker_lambda('/my/root')
assert abs_path('a', 'b') == '/my/root/a/b'
```

The lambda version works but lacks readability and cannot be pickled, making it impractical for many real-world applications. `mk_factory` is a clean, powerful alternative that adheres more closely to Python's functional style.

## Examples Using `mk_factory`

Here are ten examples demonstrating practical uses for `mk_factory` across data science, API work, and utility tasks. 

### Standard Library Examples

1. **File Path Prefixer**  
   Fixed root directory path generator with `os.path.join`.

   ```python
   import os
   mk_abs_path_maker = mk_factory(os.path.join)
   abs_path_maker = mk_abs_path_maker("/base/directory")
   abs_path_maker("subdir", "file.txt")  # "/base/directory/subdir/file.txt"
   ```

2. **Hex Converter with Fixed Prefix**  
   Generate hex strings with a fixed prefix.

   ```python
   mk_hex_with_prefix = mk_factory(hex)
   hex_with_prefix = mk_hex_with_prefix(0xABCDEF00)
   hex_with_prefix(12345)  # "0xabcdef0012345"
   ```

3. **Environment Variable Getter**  
   Retrieve environment variables with a fixed default.

   ```python
   import os
   mk_env_getter = mk_factory(os.getenv)
   env_with_default = mk_env_getter("default_value")
   env_with_default("NON_EXISTENT_VAR")  # "default_value"
   ```

4. **URL Opener with Fixed Base**  
   Open URLs on a fixed base site, useful for web scraping.

   ```python
   import urllib.parse
   mk_url_opener = mk_factory(urllib.parse.urljoin)
   url_opener = mk_url_opener("https://example.com/api/v1/")
   url_opener("users/123")  # "https://example.com/api/v1/users/123"
   ```

5. **JSON Dump Formatter**  
   Serialize data with specific indentation for readability.

   ```python
   import json
   mk_json_dumper = mk_factory(json.dumps)
   pretty_json_dumper = mk_json_dumper(indent=4)
   pretty_json_dumper({"name": "Alice", "age": 30})  # Formatted JSON string
   ```

### Data Science Examples

6. **Random Data Generator with Fixed Seed**  
   Reproducible random data generation with `numpy`.

   ```python
   import numpy as np
   mk_random_with_seed = mk_factory(np.random.default_rng)
   rng_with_seed = mk_random_with_seed(42)
   rng_with_seed().normal(0, 1, 5)  # Array with fixed-seed random values
   ```

7. **DataFrame Column Renamer**  
   Rename DataFrame columns with a fixed convention.

   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   mk_column_renamer = mk_factory(pd.DataFrame.rename)
   column_renamer = mk_column_renamer(columns={"old_name": "new_name"})
   column_renamer(pd.DataFrame({"old_name": [1, 2, 3]}))  # DataFrame with renamed column
   ```

8. **DataFrame Grouper for Aggregations**  
   Group DataFrame data by a specific column for repeat analysis.

   ```python
   mk_grouper = mk_factory(pd.DataFrame.groupby)
   age_grouper = mk_grouper("age")

   # Group data by age column and calculate mean of other columns
   df = pd.DataFrame({"age": [20, 20, 30, 30], "score": [88, 92, 95, 85]})
   print(age_grouper(df).mean())
   # Output: DataFrame with mean score for each age group
   ```

9. **Numpy Array Reshaper with Fixed Shape**  
   Reshape arrays to a consistent shape.

   ```python
   mk_reshaper = mk_factory(np.reshape)
   reshaper_to_2x2 = mk_reshaper((2, 2))
   reshaper_to_2x2(np.array([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # 2x2 matrix [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
   ```

10. **Fixed Scaler for Feature Standardization**  
    Standardize data with a fixed `StandardScaler` for consistent feature scaling.

    ```python
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
    mk_scaler_transformer = mk_factory(StandardScaler)
    scaler = mk_scaler_transformer()
    scaler.fit_transform([[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]])  # Scaled data
    ```

With `mk_factory`, you unlock a wealth of possibilities for creating flexible, reusable functions. It's a simple but powerful twist on functional programming that can be a game-changer in making code modular, readable, and efficient. Whether for data science, API management, or general-purpose utility, `mk_factory` enables a functional approach that keeps code clean and concise.
