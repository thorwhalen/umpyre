## Know ALL dict methods well

Look for recipes and advanced uses of `dict`. Examples (off of the top of my google):
* [python dictionaries](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/python-dictionaries/)
* [7 advanced techniques](https://towardsdatascience.com/7-advanced-python-dictionary-techniques-you-should-know-416194d82d2c)
* [advanced dict operations](https://www.python-engineer.com/courses/advancedpython/03-dict/)
