## Python is popular
Resources for doing data science in python. 

Heard that before?

Of course you have. Python is talked about a lot. By some accounts, it's the most popular language around now-a-days 
(I'm speaking from May 2020 -- you know, Covid-19 and all). That fact is debated, of course. Just to name a few that were on top of google's current stack:
- [Python more popular than ever](https://www.wired.com/story/python-language-more-popular-than-ever/)
- [Why is python so popular though slow](https://medium.com/@trungluongquang/why-python-is-popular-despite-being-super-slow-83a8320412a9)
- [Why Python will lose it's charm](https://analyticsindiamag.com/why-python-may-lose-its-charm-over-time/)

This popularity is _general_ popularity. When it comes to data science, the significance of it's superior popularity makes 
any doubters easily dismissible. Popularity doesn't necessarily mean best for all situations though. I'll let you google about context-sensitive pros and cons. Personally, miss Matlab for it's "multi-dimensional matrix as builtin type", envy R for it's plethora of statistical libraries, and fantasize about Haskell's professed abstractions and mathematically-oriented idioms. 

But.

Python wins.

Clearly.

Why? Because I want my ideas to interact in a large world. A world made of various data sources, a world made of apps, and websites, and web services, and micro-services, and visual elements. As far as being a glue language from which you can interact with all other pieces of the digital world -- python is an overall winner. 

## What's are focus here?

Resources for doing data science in python. 

You've heard it. 

Yes, you have plenty of resources to do data science in python, and you should explore these and compose your toolset. 

I have my set of tools, and I'll share them with you.
But those I would really like to to focus on here are those that have a particular flavor of:
- pragmatic AI (the kind that solves the actual problem at hand, no matter what the books say)
- data science interacting with the rest-of-the-world (where does the data come from, what will your models produce, for whom, and with what face?)
- fast development (minimizing the boring boilerplate that happens before you get to have fun)
