What I would like, when privacy concerns are addressed (or local AI is good enough) is to have AI constantly monitoring everything I do on my computer. 
What I look up, what I write, what I read, etc.Â 

I imagine having some time one day to do this:
* capture and store keyboard key-recording, browser pages, and regular screenshots (OCRed)
* constantly index this data with embeddings
* in real time, take the most recent (embeddings of) activities, retrieve past relevant snippets, and use them as a context for a "make useful suggestions" prompt
 
You know, like [clippy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Assistant), but for my whole computer, and actually smart and useful.
