Make dangerous difficult. (In Latin: _Ut facile periculi._)

If combination is easy, separation of concerns will be incentivized. 

The problem with multiple alternative truths is that everyone has plenty.
The problem with the single absolute truth is that I'm the only one who possesses it.


# From others

Make the easy things easy and the hard things possible. (Old motto from the Perl community.)
