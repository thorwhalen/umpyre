# Better manuals

Mene-path instructions like `File > Export > Convert > ...` have a few problems:
* They're are to remember, since the path words may not be relevant to the item (or the problem that lead to the need for it
* They're annoying to follow (multiple clicks)
* They're not stable (what if the menu path to the item changes?)

Instead, one can associate keywords to the item (visible or not in the item if item is text) such that
* these words better describe the item and/or the problem that would lead to a user searching for it
* that unicity is maximized -- which means that combinations of words can easily be found that are unique to this item (and have a good chance of being so in the future as well)

Not only this makes the item more easily to be found when searched, but also,
with these keywords at hand, the manual can mention one or several unique combinations of these keywords 
(instead of, or along with, a menu-path) to solve the "how do I get to the item" problem. 
A user can then have the choice of accessing the item via a help search. 
This method mitigates the menu-path problems mentioned about.
