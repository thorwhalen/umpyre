# Copying (rendered) html and pasting it in github issue or wiki text field actually copies markdown

Unfortunately, this doesn't work with a .md file (at the time or writing this). 

Example, copying the text highlighted in image below 

<img width="553" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1906276/204998920-9eb4d425-f09b-4364-8c2d-33a314b19509.png">

and pasting in an issue or wiki text field results in:

```
[GitHub â€“ Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) - The official GitHub Guide for Markdown syntax.
```
