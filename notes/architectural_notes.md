# O, modularity!

Toddlers write lines of code. 
Grown-ups write functions. Plenty of them. 

Why break lines of code into small functions? Where to start...
- It's called modularity, and that's good
- You can reuse functions (and no, copy/paste isn't D.R.Y. -- 
and if you don't know what D.R.Y. is, 
[grow up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself!)
- Because [7+-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two), 
a.k.a [chunking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology)) or Miller's Law.
- You can [decorate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_syntax_and_semantics#Decorators)
functions, not lines of code.
